# Concify
Concify is the way to go to find the most awesome concerts near you! This is done by using the Ticketmaster Discovery API. 
Searching for the artist and the city, you get all the dates for when your favorite artist is performing. You can easily share a 
concert with your friends and if you have an account you can even save them for later, if you are going. Of course you can also delete 
them when you've been to the concert. Accidentally tapped on the delete button? No worries, we got you covered by confirming if you want 
to delete. We even remember the last search you have done, so whenever you close the app and restart, you can see your last query results! 
So, have fun searching for concerts!
